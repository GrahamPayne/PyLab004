So, for me, it took some time to get this going and to clean up my code. I was following along and had a few issues pop up just getting the stacks set up right. But once I got that down, I liked how you’re basically setting everything up so you can use each part as an element. After that, you can just propagate the scene and make as many pumpkins and stars as you want. It makes sense that you wouldn’t code each one over and over again.
